// How does the internet work? What happens when you click on a link? // 
The internet works by forming a network of computers that are able to communicate with each other. By being connected, they are able to make requests for information from one another, as well as retrieve and return requested information and interact in different ways with it. By connecting to the internet I'm thus able to use my personal computer to reach out to information stored on servers and request that it be sent back and displayed on my machine.

When I click on a link, my computer (the client) requests information stored at the location that the link specifies (the server). Once the information is located (or fails to be located), the server provides an output response and sends it back to my computer for viewing. Web links break down into several parts that represent different types of information used to make the request and locate the web address content. 'http' is a standard protocol system for requesting and returning information via web browsers, the domain name locates the web domain and represents an associated numeric IP address that is used to locate the server and then find and return the contents specified via the web link.
